# AWS Assignment - Security Group

**Q1** - *What is Security Group?*

**Ans** -

	AWS security groups (SGs) are associated with EC2 instances and provide security at the protocol 
	and port access level. Each security group — working much the same way as a firewall — contains 
	a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance. Unlike network access 
	control lists (NACLs), there are no “Deny” rules. If there is no rule that explicitly permits a 
	particular data packet, it will be dropped.
