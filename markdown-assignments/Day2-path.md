# AWS Assignment - Path

- **Path is the complete location or name of where a computer, file, device, or web page is located.**
- **Path specifies a unique location in a file system.**

***Absolute Path:***

- An Abolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch until the path to the desired dir/file is completed.
- eg. C:\Users\praz1\VITADBDA-03\Cloud AWS
- If you want to reuse the code use absolute path
- Readability is high

***Relative Path:***

- Absolute path name starts with working (current) directory.
  
. --> Working directory eg. cd . (working/current dir)

.. --> Working directory's parent directory eg. cd .. (current directory's parent)
- It makes code dynamic 
- Readabilty is lost

***Which one is best ?***

- It depends on situation that which path method is suitable for that situation.
